# Exercise 1: Basic Local Git Cycle

### Overview
In this exercise we will go through one basic local Git version control cycle. You will make use of some of the most frequently used Git commands:  

 ```git status```  
 ```git init```  
 ```git add <file_with_new_changes>```  
 ```git commit -m 'my commit message'```  
 ```git log / git reflog```  
 ```git diff <name_of_changed_file>```

### Step-by-Step instructions

We start in our workshop directory. Let's make a new folder just for this exercise.

```console
>> cd ~/git_workshop2020
>> mkdir my_first_repo
>> cd my_first_repo
```

At this point the new folder is not under Git version control yet. You can see this by the output of  

```console
>> git status
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

Once you initiate Git version control for this folder, it will become a repository or "repo" and a new file .git will be created. Next, check the status of your repo. It should be empty like the one below.

```console
>> git init
>> git status
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

Can you see the hidden .git file when typing the command ```ls -al```?

Let's create our first file now! Open your favourite text editor. Write a short sentence about yourself (can be something silly like your favourite food). Then save the file in your local repo under the name name_surname.md (.md for [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)). If you now check the status again, you will see that the file appears as an untracked file.

```console
>> git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	John_Doe.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

As you can see in the output, Git already suggests the next useful command ```git add```. Let's add the file and check its status again!

```console
>> git add John_Doe.md
>> git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   John_Doe.md
```

Congratulations, Git is now tracking your file and will note any new changes automatically.

**Questions**

Go ahead and make a change in your file.
How does the output of ```git status``` change?  
Before you run ```git add``` on your modified file, try ```git diff``` What does it do?

---

Now that you have added new files to your folder and made some changes you want to create a snapshot in Git, so that you can always return to this specific point in your project progress. Such a snapshot is called a 'commit' in Git language. Make sure all changes you want to include in this commit have been added with ```git add```. With every commit you should also define a commit message that describes what changes this commit includes. For this you can use the ```-m``` flag.

```console
>> git commit -m 'adding a new file'
[main (root-commit) 9770d9c] adding a new file
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
create mode 100644 John_Doe.md
```

A new commit has now been added to your Git repo. You can check the history of your commits with the command ```git log``` or ```git reflog```. Try both commands and see how they compare!

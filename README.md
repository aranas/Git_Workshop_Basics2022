# Git_Workshop_Basics2022

## From zero to git-pull-push

This workshop teaches the basics of Git version control for absolute beginners. You have no idea what the commands pull, add or push refer to or in which order to use them? You wonder why you should invest time in learning “how to git” in the first place and why it is better than simply saving intermediate file versions ? Then this workshop is perfect for you!  We will cover all of the above and provide you with the necessary minimum skills to start using Git for your own projects. No previous knowledge required. You will need a computer with internet connection. Prior to the workshop you will need to install Git and configure it (we will send detailed instructions). You should also create a GitHub account, which we will start using together during the workshop.
